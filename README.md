# PocoLootFilter
## Installation
[**Filter download**](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rockbyo5/PocoLootFilter/main/default.filter)
1. Locate your Project Diablo 2 folder. It is usually under your original Diablo 2 folder in a folder named ***ProjectD2***.
2. (Optional) If you already configured a filter, back it up now by renaming/copying your filter. Your filter name would probably be `loot.filter` or `default.filter`.
3. To install a new filter, copy the [filter](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rockbyo5/PocoLootFilter/main/default.filter) to the `ProjectD2` folder and name it `loot.filter`. Make sure you have no `.txt` at the end of the file name. Sometime windows hides it. If you have a `.txt` at the end of the file, it can and will cause your filter not to work.
4. If you have not already, to enable the loot filter, go inside of a game and then control+click the small `settings` button in the bottom left of your screen.
5. In the new window, you need to check the box next to **Advanced item display** anbd.

## Credits
I want to thank WolfieeifloW and Sawyer from the PD2 discord for their help understanding stuff. I also want to also thank WolfieeifloW, Bulleti (EuropeBattle.net) and Anirml for their work on their own filters which i snatched small parts of and analysed to better understand how to improve mine.
